* OpenColor
  [[https://melpa.org/#/open-color][https://melpa.org/packages/open-color-badge.svg]]
  open-color.el provides minimalistic RGB color definition from [[https://yeun.github.io/open-color/][Open color]].

** Installation

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (use-package open-color
       :ensure t)
   #+END_SRC

   But most likely one may want it use as a dependency, so once it on MELPA, add

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     ;; Package-Requires: ((open-color "0.0.1"))
   #+END_SRC

   to the theme package headers, so /package.el/ could install it automatically.

** Usage

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (require 'open-color)
   #+END_SRC

   See a more complex example here: [[https://github.com/a13/lor-theme/blob/master/lor-oc-theme.el][lor-oc-theme]]

*** Available Colors
    See https://yeun.github.io/open-color/.
    Prefix  "open-color-" is added to a color name, so "black" becomes "open-color-black",  other colors have numbered suffixes, e.g. "open-color-red-9".

** Updating colors
   To update colors from upstream there's a [[https://babashka.org/][Babashka]] script included, usage:

   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
     bb update
   #+END_SRC

   or just /M-x babashka-tasks RET update/ if there's [[https://github.com/licht1stein/babashka.el][babashka.el]] available.

** TODO To do
   - Add [[https://github.com/emacsmirror/rainbow-mode][Rainbow mode]] support.
   - Extract version information
   - run generate.clj from workflows
